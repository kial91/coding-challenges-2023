# 02-Antics

## How to run

First open folder in terminal and run:

```bash
    yarn dev
```

This will display some output in the terminal, usually like this:

```bash
    # Port may vary!
    ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
    ➜  Network: use --host to expose
    ➜  press h to show help
```

Go to URL!

The ant will begin to run automatically.

If you wish to stop/start the ant you can call the following functions in the browser console:

```bash
    # Start ant
    startAnt()

    # Stop ant
    stopAnt()
```

The ant's grid does expand, eventually...
